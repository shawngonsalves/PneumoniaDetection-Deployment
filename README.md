# PneumoniaDetection-Deployment
Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Tensorflow to detect Pneumonia in a patient using their frontal Chest  X-Ray images

# Abstract
This study proposes a Convolutional Neural Network model that detects the presence of Pneumonia in a patient based on his/ her X-Ray images. The model is trained from scratch using Python and different libraries associated with Python, so it separates itself from the already pre-trained models. A chest x-ray is the best test for diagnosing pneumonia. The diagnosis of Pneumonia disease is a human-dependent study. [1]An x-ray exam will allow your doctor to see your lungs, heart, and blood vessels to help determine if the person suffers from pneumonia. When interpreting the x-ray, the radiologist will look for white spots in the lungs (called infiltrates) that identify an infection.  Having a model that detects this presence eliminates the two types of human error, which are Mistakes and Violations.  Once the model is trained with a sufficient number of training images of both Normal and Pneumonia X-rays, then the prediction for a new image is made within a matter of seconds. The trained Convolutional neural network model is then exported as a JSON model for deployment on the browser. The deployment process is done using HTML and Javascript, where the model is first fed into the browser, and then a frontal X-ray image is uploaded for inference. The model predicts if it belongs to the Normal or the Pneumonia positive class.
